=============================================

These are the codes used in the paper Benchmarking Communication in Actor- and Agent-Based Languages. All of the codes are for the configuration N = 500 000. For the other configurations simply change the appropriate values for each code.

PS. Don't forget to update Jason codes 'basedir' value at line 2 build.xml with a correct path to the base directory where that build.xml for that code is. Also update jasonJar at line 10 build.xml with a correct path to the jason.jar located on your Jason install folder.
